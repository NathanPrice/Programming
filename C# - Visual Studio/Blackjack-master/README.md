## Blackjack Card Game

This is a simplified version of the [Blackjack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) card game implemented as a
Windows Console application with Microsoft .NET 4.5 / C#.

*Time spent on this project: ~15 h. It's not polished and feature rich. The [challenge](https://twitter.com/koistya/status/416285409484607490) was to come up
with a working version in a short period of time.*
