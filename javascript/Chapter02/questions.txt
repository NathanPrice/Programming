17. A prefix operator is an operator that is placed before a variable name whereas a postfix operator is placed after. EX: Pre: ++x Post: a--
18. The result is that it prints out the text green. I know this because since 5 is greater than 4 the shorthand if else statement prints out the first thing since that's what happens if the condition that is set is true.
19. The result is 1. The operator being used is modulos which gets the remainder of an expression. Since 4 can only go into 5 one time and theirs only one remainder it prints 1 since modulos gets the remainder.
20. A global variable can be used anywhere in your script whereas a local variable can only be used within the place you defined it such as a function. Not using the var keyword can affect the scope of your variables since it will make it global by default.
